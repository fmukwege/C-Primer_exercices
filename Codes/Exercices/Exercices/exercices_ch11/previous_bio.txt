My name is KF88. Mechanical engineer and music producer from Brussels, Belgium. One could argue that this is a rather unusual profile but in my point of view, music is a science but as researchers, we use words like "acoustics" and "vibrations" to describe it properly. 

The truth is that, even though they are commonly considered as 2 separate fields, music and science are and always have been closely interconnected. My first NFT collection called "Essence" is a interpretation of the 5 most abundant elements of our universe. The collection explores the connection between these two realms and captures it into one unique piece of art
