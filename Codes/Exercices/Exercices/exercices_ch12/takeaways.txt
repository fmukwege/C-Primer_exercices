Heap memory management :

You can access the heap through the new, delete keywords, shared_ptr, unique_ptr, weak_ptr  and allocator objects from the stl

- Prefer using smart pointers 
- Avoid mixing raw and smart pointers 
- if a smart pointer and a raw pointer points to the same memory slot, do not free through delete !
- allocator allows to encapsulate the meory allocation. It helps by separating allocation and do construction in two steps.
    - first you allocate raw, unconstructed memory for a given type
    - then you construct it and initialize it
These 2 actions are done at the same time with usual pointers (raw and smart) but here, we allow to separate it. 
Do not forget to destroy the allocator and deallocate it after !
