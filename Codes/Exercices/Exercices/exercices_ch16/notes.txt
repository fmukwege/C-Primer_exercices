Generic programming and templates


Templates : 

1. Use them when you need multiple version of the same fct w/ the same body (when Overloading would'have been tedious)
2. Functions templates must be defined in their headers (no split of the declaration and the definition)
3. Functions and class can be written as templates.
    - For classes, the member functions are defined as templates since the compiler will produce a version at run time for each
